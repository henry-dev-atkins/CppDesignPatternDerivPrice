# C++ Design patters and derivatives Pricing 

by Mark S. Joshi

I am using this book to learn C++. The code within each folder should compile independently (except for a couple of inter-chapter header files). The CMAKE stuff has been added now for redundency, as after the last chapter I will make some complete executables (will be listed below in due time) that will use the Chapters as a library.

## Chapter 1:

- [ ] Modify to Price Puts

- [ ] Modify to Price Double Digitals

- [ ] Modify to accept a string option Payoff

- [x] Class Identifiers


## Chapter 2:

- [ ] Modify Payoff class to handle Digital Options

- [ ] Modify Payoff class to handle Double Digital Options

- [ ] Test whether using const speeds up code on your compiler
